================================================================================
WATER YEAR CONCEPTS AND CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

WATER YEAR DEFINITION:
- Water Year 2024: October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024
- Water Day 0: October 1 (start of water year)
- Water Day 365/366: September 30 (end of water year)

LEAP YEAR HANDLING (FULLY FUTURE-PROOF):
The application automatically handles leap years correctly for ANY year:
- Water Year 2024: 366 days (contains Feb 29, 2024)
- Water Year 2025: 365 days (no leap day)
- Water Year 2100: 365 days (century year, not divisible by 400)
- Water Year 2400: 366 days (millennium year, divisible by 400)
- Handles ALL Gregorian calendar rules automatically

WATER DAY CALCULATION (FUTURE-PROOF FOR ANY YEAR):
- Precise decimal calculations for fractional days
- Example: Day 45.25 = 45 days + 6 hours after water year start
- Works for any water year: 1900, 2021, 2024, 2025, 2100, 2400, etc.
- Consistent with hydrological modeling standards
- Visual water year boundaries shown on plots
- Automatic leap year and century rule handling

YEAR ASSIGNMENT IN WYO FILES (FUTURE-PROOF):
- Calendar year determined by actual date calculation using Python datetime
- Water Day 0 (Oct 1) → Previous calendar year automatically
- Water Day ~92 (Jan 1) → Current calendar year automatically  
- Water Day 365/366 (Sep 30) → Current calendar year automatically
- Works for ANY year: 2021, 2024, 2025, 2100, etc.
- Automatically handles leap years and century rules
- Ensures proper temporal continuity in WYO format

ANOMALY DETECTION:
- Pre-season data: Negative water day values
- Post-season data: Water day > year length
- Comprehensive reporting in processing log
- Visual indicators in data statistics panel

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:

1. "Cannot access http://127.0.0.1:8050"
