FILTER ORDER SELECTION GUIDE
================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING FILTER ORDER: MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION

Filter order is one of the most critical parameters in frequency filtering, directly 
controlling the "sharpness" of your filter's frequency response. Understanding the
mathematical basis helps you make informed decisions for your temperature analysis.

MATHEMATICAL BASIS:

Filter order (N) appears as an exponent in the fundamental Butterworth equation:

   |H(ω)|² = 1 / (1 + (ω/ωc)^(2N))

Where:
   - H(ω) = Frequency response at frequency ω
   - ωc = Cutoff frequency
   - N = Filter order ← THE KEY PARAMETER

This exponential relationship means that small changes in filter order have
dramatic effects on filtering performance.

KEY MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS:

1. ROLLOFF RATE:
   Formula: Rolloff Rate = -20N dB/decade = -6N dB/octave
   
   Examples:
   - Order 2: -40 dB/decade rolloff
   - Order 3: -60 dB/decade rolloff (DEFAULT - recommended)
   - Order 6: -120 dB/decade rolloff
   - Order 12: -240 dB/decade rolloff

2. STOPBAND REJECTION:
   At 2× cutoff frequency (ω = 2ωc):
   - Order 1: |H(2ωc)|² = 1/(1 + 2²) = 1/5 = 84% rejection
   - Order 3: |H(2ωc)|² = 1/(1 + 2⁶) = 1/65 = 99% rejection ← YOUR DEFAULT
   - Order 6: |H(2ωc)|² = 1/(1 + 2¹²) = 1/4097 = 99.98% rejection

3. IMPULSE RESPONSE DURATION:
   Formula: Duration ≈ N/(2π × fc)
   
   For daily temperature cycles (fc = 1.0 day⁻¹):
   - Order 3: ~0.48 days = 11.5 hours of "memory" ← OPTIMAL
   - Order 6: ~0.95 days = 23 hours of "memory"
   - Order 12: ~1.9 days = 46 hours of "memory"

PRACTICAL FILTER ORDER GUIDELINES:

ORDER SELECTION MATRIX:

| Order | Rolloff | Rejection | Memory | Best For | Ringing Risk |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| 2     | -40dB   | 80%       | 7.6h   | Noisy data, preserve shape | Very Low ✅ |
| 3     | -60dB   | 99%       | 11.5h  | **OPTIMAL for temperature** | Low ✅ |
| 4     | -80dB   | 99.8%     | 15.3h  | Need sharper cutoff | Low-Med ⚠️ |
| 6     | -120dB  | 99.98%    | 23h    | High precision required | Medium ⚠️ |
| 8+    | -160dB+ | 99.99%+   | 30h+   | Very long datasets only | High ❌ |

DETAILED ORDER CHARACTERISTICS:

**ORDER 2 - CONSERVATIVE CHOICE:**
- Mathematical: (ω/ωc)⁴ rolloff term
- Use when: Data is noisy, preserve natural temperature curves
- Pros: Minimal ringing, stable, works with short data records
- Cons: Gentle rolloff may allow some unwanted frequencies through
- Best for: <10 days of data, preserve rapid temperature changes

**ORDER 3 - OPTIMAL DEFAULT (RECOMMENDED):**
- Mathematical: (ω/ωc)⁶ rolloff term
- Use when: Standard temperature analysis (YOUR CURRENT SETTING)
- Pros: 99% rejection, 11.5h memory, excellent stability
- Cons: None significant for typical temperature applications
- Best for: Most temperature applications, peak/trough detection
- Mathematical justification: Perfect balance of frequency precision and stability

**ORDER 4-6 - HIGH PRECISION:**
- Mathematical: (ω/ωc)⁸ to (ω/ωc)¹² rolloff terms
- Use when: Need very sharp frequency separation
- Pros: Excellent frequency selectivity, <0.1% leakage
- Cons: Longer memory, potential for mild ringing
- Best for: >20 days of data, multiple frequency components

**ORDER 8+ - SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS:**
- Mathematical: (ω/ωc)¹⁶+ rolloff terms
- Use when: Months of data, extreme precision required
- Pros: Near-perfect frequency separation
- Cons: Strong ringing risk, requires very long data records
- Best for: Climate studies, very long time series only

TEMPERATURE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

**FOR YOUR TYPICAL APPLICATION:**

Default Order 3 is mathematically optimal because:

1. **Sufficient Frequency Separation:**
   At 2× daily frequency (2 day⁻¹): 99% rejection
   At 10× daily frequency (10 day⁻¹): 99.999% rejection
   
2. **Reasonable Time Response:**
   11.5-hour memory preserves natural temperature curve shapes
   Minimal phase distortion for accurate peak/trough timing
   
3. **Numerical Stability:**
   Well-conditioned filter coefficients
   Robust to parameter variations and numerical errors

**WHEN TO ADJUST FROM ORDER 3:**

**Decrease to Order 2 if you observe:**
- Artificial oscillations in filtered temperature data
- "Ringing" around sharp temperature transitions
- Unnatural smoothness that removes real temperature features
- False peaks/valleys in filtered results

**Increase to Order 4-6 if you observe:**
- High-frequency noise still visible in daily temperature cycles
- Insufficient separation between daily and semi-daily components
- Spectral leakage from adjacent frequency bands
- Need sharper filter band definition

**Never exceed Order 8 unless:**
- You have >60 days of continuous data
- You've verified no ringing artifacts appear
- Extreme frequency precision is required for your analysis

MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION FOR YOUR DATA:

For bandpass filter (0.8-1.2 day⁻¹), Order 3:

1. **Frequency Selectivity Check:**
   At 0.4 day⁻¹ (twice-daily): -18dB = 98.4% rejection ✅
   At 2.4 day⁻¹ (semi-daily): -18dB = 98.4% rejection ✅

2. **Time Domain Check:**
   Filter duration: 11.5 hours
   For daily cycles (24h period): 11.5/24 = 48% overlap ✅
   Acceptable for temperature curve preservation

3. **Data Length Check:**
   Minimum recommended: 3 × 11.5h = 34.5 hours = 1.4 days
   Your typical data: >>1.4 days ✅

4. **Edge Effect Check:**
   Buffer needed: 11.5 hours at each end
   Impact on analysis: Minimal for multi-day records ✅

ADVANCED ORDER OPTIMIZATION:

**Quick Test Protocol:**
1. Start with Order 3 (default)
2. Apply filter and examine results
3. Check for artifacts:
   - Artificial peaks/valleys → Reduce to Order 2
   - Insufficient noise removal → Increase to Order 4
   - Timing shifts in temperature events → Reduce order
   - Spectral leakage in PSD → Increase order

**Mathematical Validation:**
1. Compare filtered vs. raw temperature amplitude
2. Check phase preservation at daily frequency
3. Verify edge effects are acceptable
4. Confirm no artificial frequency content appears

**Order vs. Data Length Guidelines:**
- Order 2: Works with 5+ days of data
- Order 3: Optimal for 7+ days of data ← YOUR SWEET SPOT
- Order 6: Requires 14+ days of data
- Order 12: Requires 30+ days of data

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES:

**SCENARIO 1: Standard Diurnal Analysis**
Data: 30 days, 20-minute intervals
Goal: Extract daily temperature cycles
Recommended: Order 3 (your default) ✅
Justification: Plenty of data, standard application, proven stable

**SCENARIO 2: Noisy Stream Temperature**  
Data: 14 days, high-frequency sensor noise
Goal: Preserve natural temperature curves
Recommended: Order 2
Justification: Shorter data, prioritize shape preservation

**SCENARIO 3: Multi-Component Analysis**
Data: 60 days, need to separate daily/semi-daily/low-frequency
Goal: Sharp frequency band separation
Recommended: Order 4-6
Justification: Long data record, need precision separation

**SCENARIO 4: Short-Term Study**
Data: 7 days, 1-minute intervals
Goal: Remove sensor noise, preserve all temperature signals
Recommended: Order 2
Justification: Short record, preserve all real temperature variation

MATHEMATICAL BOTTOM LINE:

Your current Order 3 setting represents the mathematical optimum for temperature
time-series analysis:

- **Exponential term (ω/ωc)⁶ provides excellent frequency selectivity**
- **11.5-hour memory is ideal for daily temperature cycles**
- **99% stopband rejection eliminates unwanted frequencies**
- **Low ringing risk preserves natural temperature curve shapes**

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:

1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'"
   - Solution: Install missing library with: pip install [library_name]
   - For MNE specifically: pip install mne
   - For tkinter: Usually included with Python, try reinstalling Python

2. "Default file not found"
   - Solution: Check that the file specified in tts_freqfilt.par exists
   - The script searches in: current directory, script directory, and specified path
   - Use "Browse Different File" to locate and load the correct file
   - **Check log files for detailed file search information**

3. "Permission denied" when saving files
   - Solution: Check that output folder is writable
   - Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Mac/Linux)
   - Use "Change" button to select a different output folder
   - **Review log files for specific permission error details**

4. "Address already in use" error
   - Solution: Close other instances of the application
   - Or change port by editing the last line: app.run(debug=True, port=8051)

5. Browser doesn't open automatically
   - Solution: Manually open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8051

6. PSD plot shows errors or strange results
   - Check data format (must have WaterDay, TempShallow, TempDeep columns)
   - Ensure data contains numeric values only
   - Try different PSD method if one fails (switch from MATLAB MTM to Welch)
   - **Check detailed log files for PSD computation error messages**

7. **Filter fails to apply or produces strange results**
   - Check that low frequency < high frequency
   - Ensure frequencies are within valid range (< Nyquist frequency)
   - **Try lower filter order if getting errors (reduce from 6 to 3 to 2)**
   - **If you see artificial oscillations, reduce filter order**
   - **If insufficient noise removal, gradually increase filter order**
   - **Review filter validation log entries for specific warnings**

8. "Multitaper method not available"
   - Install MNE library: pip install mne
   - Use alternative methods (MATLAB MTM, Welch) if MNE installation fails
   - **Check startup log messages for MNE availability status**

9. File browser doesn't open
   - Ensure tkinter is installed and working
   - On Linux, may need: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   - Try drag-and-drop upload as alternative
   - **Check log files for file browser error messages**

10. **Filter produces artificial peaks or ringing**
    - **SOLUTION: Reduce filter order from current setting to 2**
    - Check if data length is sufficient for chosen filter order
    - Consider using wider frequency bands (reduce selectivity)
    - Verify data quality doesn't have sharp discontinuities
    - **Review filter validation log entries for order-specific warnings**

11. **Insufficient noise removal from temperature data**
    - **SOLUTION: Gradually increase filter order from 3 to 4 to 6**
    - Check if frequency band is appropriate for your noise characteristics
    - Consider using different filter type (Chebyshev instead of Butterworth)
    - Verify PSD shows clear separation between signal and noise
    - **Check log files for filter performance validation results**

12. **Log files not created or log folder missing (NEW)**
    - Ensure script has write permissions in its directory
    - Check that Python can create folders in the script location
    - On Linux/Mac, may need to adjust permissions: chmod 755 [script_directory]
    - Try running as administrator if permission issues persist
    - **Log folder is created automatically in the same directory as tts_freqfilt.py**

13. **Performance issues with large datasets (NEW)**
    - Monitor log files for processing time information
    - Consider data clipping to focus on specific time periods
    - Reduce PSD resolution (lower NFFT) for faster computation
    - Use simpler PSD methods (Welch instead of Multitaper) for large datasets
    - **Review detailed log files for memory usage and computation times**

14. **Inconsistent results between analysis sessions (NEW)**
    - Compare parameter files saved between sessions
    - Review operations log for different parameter sets used
    - Use detailed log files to identify parameter changes
    - Save parameter files after optimal settings are determined
    - **Detailed logging enables exact reproduction of previous analysis**
