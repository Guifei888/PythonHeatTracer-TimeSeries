# Temperature Time-Series Frequency Filter Parameters
# Parameter file for tts_frefil.py
#
# Format: parameter_name = value
# Lines starting with # are comments

# ===== General =====
# Filename of composite data file (output from tts_merpar.py)
# Should contain columns: WaterDay, TempShallow, TempDeep
filename_composite_data = temperature_composite_data.csv

# Data interval in minutes between consecutive measurements
# This helps verify data integrity and calculate sampling frequency
data_interval_minutes = 20

# Time-bandwidth parameter for multitaper spectral analysis
# Higher values give better frequency resolution but less time resolution
# Typical values: 2-5 (4 is a good default)
time_bandwidth_parameter = 4

# ===== Spectral Analysis =====
# Water Day (WD) limits to constrain spectral analysis to specific time range
# Use -1 for both to analyze entire dataset
# Example: wd_lower_limit = 100, wd_upper_limit = 200 analyzes days 100-200 only
wd_lower_limit = -1
wd_upper_limit = -1

# ===== Filter =====
# Start of frequency band pass (lower cutoff frequency in day^-1)
# For diurnal (daily) cycles, typically around 0.8 day^-1
start_band_pass = 0.8

# End of frequency band pass (upper cutoff frequency in day^-1)
# For diurnal (daily) cycles, typically around 1.2 day^-1
end_band_pass = 1.2

# Band pass ramp/taper fraction (0.0 to 0.5)
# Controls smoothness of filter transitions at band edges
# 0.1 = 10% taper on each side of the passband
# 0.5 = 50% taper (recommended in specifications for optimal performance)
ramp_fraction = 0.1

# Filter order (integer, typically 2-20)
# Higher order = sharper frequency cutoff but potential for ringing
# 6 is a good balance for most applications
filter_order = 6

# Resample interval in minutes for output data
# Usually same as data_interval_minutes to maintain original sampling
# Can be different to upsample/downsample (e.g., 10 for finer, 30 for coarser)
resample_interval = 20

# ===== Output =====
# Output folder name for filtered data files
# This folder will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
# All filtered CSV files will be saved in this folder
# Use descriptive names like "Filter Data", "Filtered_Results", "Output_Files", etc.
